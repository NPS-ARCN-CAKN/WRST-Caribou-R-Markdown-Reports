## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

kbl(mtcars[1:10, 1:6], caption = "Group Rows") %>%
  kable_paper("striped", full_width = F) %>%
  pack_rows("Group 1", 4, 7) %>%
  pack_rows("Group 2", 8, 10)


```
